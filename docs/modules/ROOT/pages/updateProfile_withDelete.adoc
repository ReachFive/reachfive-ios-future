= updateProfile with delete

[.signature]
[subs="normal"]
----
AppDelegate.reachfive().updateProfile(<<authToken>>, <<ProfileUpdate>>)
----

== Description

Update a user profile including removing a field.

IMPORTANT: This method allows you to remove a field from the user profile, whereas the xref:updateProfile.adoc[] method only lets you update fields.

[NOTE]
====
* The profile must have been granted the `full_write` scope at the last authentication.
* The `email` and the `password` fields of the profile can't be updated with this method, except if the profile has no email address (usually when it is not provided by the social provider).
Instead, use the xref:updateEmail.adoc[] method.
* The `phoneNumber` field of the profile can't be updated if the SMS feature is activated on the account settings.
