= iOS use cases

There are a few different ways that you can leverage our {company} iOS SDK.
How you use it depends on your specific requirements and technical ecosystem.
This page provides an overview of important key terms for our iOS SDK as well as as the primary ways in which you can leverage it.

There are several potential use cases.
However, there are two core use cases that we would like to cover here, which primarily focus around whether the login is native or web-based.

* <<You want to authenticate users natively within your iOS app>>
* <<You want to reuse your website authentication inside your iOS app>>

== You want to authenticate users natively within your iOS app

[.released]#icon:check-square-o[] Recommended#

This is possible using native SDK methods, for example with xref:loginWithPassword.adoc[].
Allowing your users to log in natively from your iOS application is of course the ideal solution.
This is the approach we recommend when it's possible for your setup.

In this scenario, access tokens, refresh tokens, and cookies are handled inside the iOS app.
You're able to share these with <<WKWebView>> as well if needed.

Using the native approach, users authenticates in the native iOS application and navigate through the mobile app.
They can leverage their native app session on other mobile apps as long as it is synchronised with their Apple account and implemented by the integrator (that's you).
This is possible by link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/keychain_items/sharing_access_to_keychain_items_among_a_collection_of_apps/[icon:apple[] Apple docs: Sharing keychain items among apps^].

== You want to reuse your website authentication inside your iOS app

If you have an iOS app but prefer to use your existing authentication/login page from your website or third-party social provider, you have a couple of options which are outlined here.

[cols="4s,6a"]
|===
|Option |Details

|Use auth page and session from your website
|You want to use both your authentication/login page from your website and also share the session from the website inside the iOS app, it is possible through <<ASWebAuthenticationSession>>.

|Use session from a second or third-party website
|You want to leverage your own social connector or a third-party one (like Facebook Login, Google Login, and so on), it is possible through <<ASWebAuthenticationSession>>.

|Use only auth page from your website
|You only want to use the authentication/login page from your website, but not necessarily the session, it's possible through either <<ASWebAuthenticationSession>> or <<WKWebView>>.

IMPORTANT: We recommend you do not use <<WKWebView>> unless there are no other options.

|===

=== ASWebAuthenticationSession

ASWebAuthenticationSession is an Apple-provided API that allows apps to perform web-based authentication using the system's default browser (Safari).
It presents a secure, single sign-on (SSO) experience without requiring users to leave the app.

ASWebAuthenticationSession uses Safari's existing session data to facilitate authentication but keeps the session isolated, meaning Safari's cookies are not accessible to the native app context.

The app receives the necessary tokens (e.g., access and refresh tokens) after the user successfully authenticates, but it does not directly access or manipulate Safari's cookies.

* When your users authenticate through your website (in Safari) and use your mobile iOS app to navigate through other native screens.

If your users typically authenticate on your website first and use a hybrid mobile app approach to navigate screens, this approach is not recommended.
This is because the Safari session cookie isn't shared with the app.

=== WKWebView

WKWebView is a web view component that allows developers to embed web content within their app.
This can be used to present a web-based login form directly within the app.

CAUTION: OAuth and Apple security standards discourage using this approach as it uses insecure communication channels.

<<You want to authenticate users natively within your iOS app, Native mobile app>>::
A mobile app that relies only on screens built using native context, without any external web context.
