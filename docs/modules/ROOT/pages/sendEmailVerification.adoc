== Response

Type: `Future<EmailVerificationResponse, ReachFiveError>`

The response is an `EmailVerificationResponse` enum with two cases:

* `.Success`: Indicates the email verification process completed without requiring further action.
* `.VerificationNeeded(ContinueEmailVerification)`: Indicates a verification email was sent, and further action (e.g., entering a verification code) is required to <<Completing the flow icon:random[], complete the process>>. 

The promise is rejected and returns a `ReachFiveError` if:

* The parameters are invalid.
* The email template is incomplete.

include::partial$models.adoc[tag=reachfiveerror]

=== Completing the flow icon:random[]

Use `continueEmailVerification.verify(code: String, email: String, freshAuthToken: AuthToken? = nil)` or xref:verifyEmail.adoc[] to complete the verification.
