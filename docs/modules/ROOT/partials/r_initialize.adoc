= Initialize iOS SDK

You must initialize the iOS SDK to use it.
Initializing the iOS SDK ensures the client configuration is properly fetched (which contains default scope) and native social providers are properly initialized.

You initialize your iOS client with:

[source,swift]
----
   reachfive.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
----

== Full examples

The full file examples below show you were to initialize the client as well as providing context for the overall configuration and initialization.

[source, swift]
----
import UIKit <1>
import IdentitySdkCore

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    let DOMAIN    = "Here paste your ReachFive domain" <2>
    let CLIENT_ID = "Here paste your ReachFive client ID" <3>

    let reachfive = ReachFive( 
        // The configuration parameters required to initialize the ReachFive client
        sdkConfig: SdkConfig(domain: DOMAIN, clientId: CLIENT_ID)
    )

    // Return the ReachFive client
    static func reachfive() -> ReachFive {
        let app = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate
        return app.reachfive
    }

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Initialize the ReachFive client
        return reachfive.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions) <4>
    }
}
----
<1> Import the UIKit if using it.
If using another UI framework, you may not initialize provider configuration.
<2> Your {company} domain such as `integ-sandbox.reach5.dev`.
<3> The {company} client such as `zhU43...51nvOM`;
<4> Initializing the {company} client.

<1> An example of how to access of the {company} object from within the app.
<2> This method is used to handle universal links which are used by providers.
<3> This method is used to handle callback schemes which are used by passwordless and MFA as well as for account recovery, and providers.
<4> This method is used to provide functionality to the providers.
