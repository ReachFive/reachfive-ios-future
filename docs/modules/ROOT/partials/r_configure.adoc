= Configure the iOS SDK

You must configure the iOS SDK to use it.
This is where you provide the values for your domain and client ID, and define which native library you want to integrate with for Social Login.

By default, the URL scheme follows this  pattern: `reachfive-$\{clientId\}://callback`.

There are multiple schemes.
All *must be* whitelisted in Allowed Callback URLs on your {cc}.

[cols="4m,6a"]
|===
|Allowed URL |Notes

|reachfive-$\{clientId\}://callback
|This callback URL is used to open the app from another app such as an email client or the web for passwordless.

Other uses:

* Switching from web context to app context in `webviewLogin`.
* OAuth flow

|reachfive-$\{clientId\}://mfa
|This callback URL is used for MFA verification.

Available from version `6.3.0`.

|reachfive-$\{clientId\}://account-recovery
|This callback URL is used for account recovery code verification.

Available from version `7.0.0`.

== Configuration

[source,swift,subs="normal,callouts"]
----
let reachfive = ReachFive(
    // The configuration parameters required to initialize the ReachFive client
    sdkConfig: SdkConfig( <1>
        domain: DOMAIN,
        clientId: CLIENT_ID
        ),
    // The list of the social providers needed by the application
    providersCreators: [GoogleProvider(), FacebookProvider(), WeChatProvider()] <2>
)
----
<1> Sets the required parameters such as `domain`, {company} `clientId`, and the `scheme`.
<2> Lists the social providers you need for your iOS application.

=== Customise `scheme`

You can also specify a scheme manually and customise schemes as shown here.

[source,swift,subs="verbatim,callouts"]
----
let ReachFive = ReachFive(
    sdkConfig: SdkConfig(
        domain: DOMAIN,
        clientId: CLIENT_ID,
        scheme: "reachfive-${clientId}://myOwnScheme", <1>
        mfaUri: "reachfive-${clientId}://myOwnMfaScheme", <2>
        accountRecoveryUri: "reachfive-${clientId}://myOwnRecoveryScheme" <3>
    )
)
----
<1> Where the callback `scheme` ends with `myOwnScheme`.
<2> Where the callback mfaUri `scheme` ends with `myOwnMfaScheme`.
<3> Where the callback accountRecoveryUri `scheme` ends with `myOwnRecoveryScheme`.

=== Customise storage

Storage is used by the iOS SDK to store the PKCE code during passwordless and MFA flows.

By default it uses the link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults[UserDefaults storage^], but it can be customised to be any object that implements our link:https://github.com/ReachFive/reachfive-ios/blob/master/Sources/Core/Classes/utils/Storage.swift[`Storage` protocol^].

For an example of a custom implementation, see link:https://github.com/ReachFive/reachfive-ios/blob/master/Sandbox/Sandbox/SecureStorage.swift[{company}-ios: Secure storage^] using the keychain.

[source,swift,subs="verbatim,callouts"]
----
let ReachFive = ReachFive(
    sdkConfig: SdkConfig(
        domain: DOMAIN,
        clientId: CLIENT_ID
    ),
    storage: UserDefaultsStorage()
)
----
<1> This value can be any object that implements our `Storage` protocol.
